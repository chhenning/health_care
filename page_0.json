            "Important Questions": "What is the overall deductible?",
            "Answers": "$1,500/person or $2,800/member or $3,000/family for In-Network Providers. $3,000/person or $3,000/member or $6,000/family for Non-Network Providers.",
            "Why This Matters": "Generally, you must pay all of the costs from providers up to the deductible amount before this plan begins to pay. If you have other family members on the plan, each family member must meet their own individual deductible until the total amount of deductible expenses paid by all family members meets the overall family deductible."

            "Important Questions": "Are there services covered before you meet your deductible?",
            "Answers": "Yes. Preventive Care for In-Network Providers. Vision for In-Network and Non-Network Providers.",
            "Why This Matters": "This plan covers some items and services even if you haven’t yet met the deductible amount. But a copayment or coinsurance may apply. For example, this plan covers certain preventive services without cost-sharing and before you meet your deductible. See a list of covered preventive services at https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/."

            "Important Questions": "What is the out-of-pocket limit for this plan?",
            "Answers": "$6,450/person or $6,450/member or $12,900/family for In-Network Providers. $7,500/person or $7,500/member or $15,000/family for Non-Network Providers.",
            "Why This Matters": "The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay in a year for covered services. If you have other family members in this plan, they have to meet their own out-of-pocket limits until the overall family out-of-pocket limit has been met."
        },
        {
            "Important Questions": "What is not included in the out-of-pocket limit?",
            "Answers": "Premiums, balance-billing charges, and health care this plan doesn’t cover.",
            "Why This Matters": "Even though you pay these expenses, they don’t count toward the out-of-pocket limit."
        },
        {
            "Important Questions": "Will you pay less if you use a network provider?",
            "Answers": "Yes. Prudent Buyer PPO. See www.anthem.com/ca or call (855) 333-5730 for a list of network providers.",
            "Why This Matters": "This plan uses a provider network. You will pay less if you use a provider in the plan’s network. You will pay the most if you use an Out-of-Network Provider, and you might receive a bill from a provider for the difference between the provider’s charge and what your plan pays (balance billing)."
